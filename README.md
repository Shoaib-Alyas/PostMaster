# PostMaster

## Description
PostMaster is a simple and powerful post management application built using **React** and **Redux**. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and display posts in a clean user interface. Each post has an author, content, and timestamp. The app also uses local storage for persistence, enabling posts to be saved locally and accessed even after a page refresh (on the client side).

### Features
- **Add Post**: Users can create new posts by specifying a title, author, and content.
- **Edit Post**: Users can update an existing post's title and content.
- **Delete Post**: Users can delete posts from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Posts are saved using `localStorage` for persistence between sessions.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean and simple design using Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A state management library for handling global state in the app.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplifies Redux setup and logic.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **date-fns**: A modern date utility library for formatting and calculating date differences.
